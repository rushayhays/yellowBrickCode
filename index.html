                <h2>The wizard of Oz is a musical</h2>
                <p>In sepia-toned Kansas, Dorothy Gale lives with her Cairn Terrier, Toto, on a farm belonging to her Aunt Em and Uncle Henry, who employ the quirky farmhands Zeke, Hunk and Hickory. Toto bites the wealthy and grouchy Miss Almira Gulch on the leg, leading her to obtain a sheriff's order to have him destroyed. Miss Gulch takes Toto away, but he escapes and returns to Dorothy; she decides to run away to save her dog. Not far from the farm, she runs into Professor Marvel, a charlatan fortune-teller who uses his crystal ball to make Dorothy believe that Aunt Em is heartbroken. Dorothy rushes home as a tornado approaches. Aunt Em, Uncle Henry, and the farmhands take shelter in the storm cellar and lock it behind them. Dorothy has to seek shelter in her bedroom, where the window is blown in and hits her on the head, knocking her unconscious. The house is sent spinning into the air, and she awakens to see various figures fly by, including Miss Gulch, who transforms into a witch, flying on a broomstick.</p>
